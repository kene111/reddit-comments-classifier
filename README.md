# Reddit Comments Classifier

### AIM:
The aim of this task is to build a machine learning classification model that classifies commments (text) into three categories namely:
- ```medical_doctor```
- ```veterinarian```
- ```other```

### DATASET:
The dataset contains 3275 samples with 3 columns. The name of the columns are:
- ```username```

Notebook Breakdown:
- ```Reddit_Comment_Classifier.ipynb```: This notebook shows the process in developing the classification model as well as the reason for the selecting the best classification model.
- ```Reddit_Comment_Classifier_Inference.ipynb```: This notebooks provides a simple work through to which the serialized best classication model is used for inferencing.
